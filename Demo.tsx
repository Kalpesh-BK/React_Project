Let me walk you through the Attachment Page we've developed, which is a key part of the user experience.

This page is designed to behave slightly differently based on whether it’s a single-life or multi-life case — so the user always sees the most relevant and streamlined layout for their scenario.

For single life, the layout is clean and focused, since there's only one individual involved.

For multi-life, we’ve included separate sections or a structured layout to handle documents for multiple individuals — this helps avoid confusion and keeps the flow organized.


We’ve also implemented a file upload feature where the user can easily drag and drop or browse to upload documents.

There are a few important things to note here:

We’ve enforced a 1 MB size limit on uploads to ensure fast performance and avoid any unnecessary delays.

The system accepts a wide range of file types — not just PDFs, but also common formats like images, Word documents, and others, giving flexibility to the user.

There’s also a delete option — so if someone accidentally uploads the wrong file, they can quickly remove it before submitting.


Overall, this page is built to be user-friendly, responsive, and practical for real-world use cases. It ensures compliance with constraints, but without compromising on usability. The design is clean and efficient, and we’ve tested it across different user types to make sure the experience remains consistent and intuitive.

We’d be happy to take feedback and improve it further, but the current version is ready for demo or deployment."











If your alarm clock had a voice, what insult would it throw at you every morning?

What weird food combo do you swear by that would get you kicked out of a cooking show?

If your boss gave you a surprise holiday tomorrow, how fast would you disappear and where to?

If you suddenly got 1 crore rupees, what’s the first completely useless thing you'd buy?


Myth: “I’ll start eating healthy from Monday.”

Myth: “Joining early means leaving early.”

Myth: “I’m just taking a 5-minute break.”


5. Myth: “This Excel sheet will only take 10 minutes.”

Myth: “Turning off the camera means I’m listening better.”

Awesome, Kalpesh! Involving the audience with color flags adds energy and fun — perfect for engagement.

Segment: Audience Pick (Flag Voting Round)

Setup:

The audience gets two colored flags:

Red = Guest 1

Blue = Guest 2


You (Kalpesh) and Tejal ask a question to both guests.

Guests answer one by one, then audience raises the flag for the answer they think was better, funnier, or more accurate.

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { fetchFinpro } from '@/lib/fetchfinpro';

// 👇 Retry wrapper around fetchFinpro
async function fetchWithRetry(retries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
    try {
      const data = await fetchFinpro();
      if (data) return data;
    } catch (err) {
      if (i === retries - 1) throw err;
    }
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000)); // wait before retry
  }
}

export default function BusinessConcept() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [errorModal, setErrorModal] = useState(false);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchWithRetry()
      .then(res => {
        setData(res);
      })
      .catch(() => {
        setErrorModal(true);
      })
      .finally(() => {
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, []);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (errorModal) return <div>Error loading data. Please try again.</div>;

  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
}





global.fetch = jest.fn(() =>

    json: () => Promise.resolve({ ip: "192.168.1.1" }),
  })
);

"use client";
If you want to use value.replace() to restrict input to 2 decimal places, you can do it inside onChange.


---

🔧 Fixed Code (Using replace() for Decimal Places)

import { useState } from "react";

export default function NumberInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");

  return (
    <div>
      <label>Enter a number (max 100, up to 2 decimals):</label>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={value}
        onChange={(e) => {
          let inputValue = e.target.value;

          // Remove unwanted characters (allow numbers, single dot, and up to 2 decimals)
          inputValue = inputValue
            .replace(/[^0-9.]/g, "") // Remove non-numeric characters except "."
            .replace(/^(\d*\.?\d{0,2}).*$/, "$1"); // Limit to 2 decimal places

          let numValue = parseFloat(inputValue);

          // Ensure value does not exceed 100
          if (!isNaN(numValue) && numValue > 100) {
            inputValue = "100";
          }

          setValue(inputValue);
        }}
        placeholder="0.00"
      />
    </div>
  );
}


---

🚀 How This Works

✅ .replace(/[^0-9.]/g, "") → Removes everything except numbers and .
✅ .replace(/^(\d*\.?\d{0,2}).*$/, "$1") → Limits to 2 decimal places
✅ Instantly resets values over 100
✅ Prevents multiple dots (99..5 ❌, 99.99 ✅)

Example Scenarios

Now, it automatically corrects the input as the user types. 🚀

Would you like any further improvements?
